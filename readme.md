=MCDzienny Decompilation=
An open source decompilation of MCDzienny which was the choice if you wanted a lava survival server. This server software wasn't updated for quite some time, and it wont be updated at all due to it's closed source nature.

==Bugs==
This decompilation has a lot of bugs such as:
*Lava does not kill you
*Physics sometimes does not work.
*The GUI does not work
*And more!
