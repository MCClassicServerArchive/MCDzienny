# MCDzienny Decompilation
An open source decompilation of MCDzienny which was the choice if you wanted a lava survival server. This server software wasn't updated for quite some time, and it wont be updated at all due to it's closed source nature.

## Bugs
This decompilation has a lot of bugs such as:
* The GUI does not work
* Adding bots results in an error, not allowing you to remove one if you add a bot.
* /clearblockchanges does not work.
* While following someone using /follow the player you are following is invisible.
* /highlight can be used in Lava Survival
* Renaming maps kinda works, but errors out.
* Restarting the server kinda works, but attempts to use the GUI frontend.
* /clearchat does nothing.
* And many more!
